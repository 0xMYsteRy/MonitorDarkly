This repo contains the exploit for the Dell 2410U monitor. It contains utilities for
communicating with and executing code on the device.

The research presented here was done in order to highlight the lack of security in "modern"
on-screen-display controllers. Please check out our Recon 0xA presentation (included) for
a detailed description of our research findings and process.

Installing
-----------

Right now, the demo has only been tested on Linux. It is known not to work on
OSX because of problems with pyusb. Ubuntu, Arch, and Fedora are known to work.
There are a few dependencies needed:

- pyusb
- imagemagick + wand (python bindings for imagemagick)
- as86 and ld86 (for assembling the payloads)

At least on Ubuntu, the following should give you all the needed dependencies:

    sudo apt-get install imagemagick python-wand python-usb bin86

Next, you need to assemble the payloads:

    cd payloads/
    make
    cd ..

Finally, with the computer plugged into the monitor's USB hub, do:

    sudo ./src/demo.py

Note that demo.py needs root permissions to run. It will first load all the
images, which takes a few minutes, and then you'll be presented with a prompt to
choose the exploit you want to run.

In addition to demo.py, src/gpio.py contains a script designed to run on the USB
Armory which uses buttons connected to the GPIO pins to launch the demos. You
can create a script to have it run on boot, for example with systemd install
something like this to /etc/systemd/system/gpio.service:

    [Unit]
    Description=GPIO handling
    
    [Service]
    ExecStart=/root/src/gpio.py
    Restart=always
    
    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target

and then on the commandline:

    systemctl enable gpio.service

To start it at boot.

There are two other demos included. funtenna.py toggles a GPIO pin, which can be
picked up by an SDR (we found a signal at 15.3 MHz). show_debug_irq.py shows how
to set up an interrupt that triggers when certain addresses are read/written,
which is useful for reverse-engineering.

How does it work?
-----------------

The Dell 2410U monitor has a Genesis (now owned by ST) display controller
onboard. The exploit sends debug messages to this chip using Genesis's "GProbe"
protocol over DDC2bi, which lets it write to RAM, read and write display
registers, execute arbitrary code, reflash the device, etc. DDC2bi is a a part
of display protocols such as HDMI and DisplayPort which normally lets the
computer do things like control the monitor's color settings and get the
resolution of the monitor. As far as we know, GProbe is always enabled via
DDC2bi on all Genesis display controllers, with no mechanism to disable it or
limit who can access it.

The exploit sends a special vendor-specific message to a fake USB storage
device in the monitor's USB hub to send DDC2bi commands to the monitor.
Theoretically, we could use DDC directly if the computer launching the exploit
is plugged into the monitor, but USB is more convenient (and dangerous) since
you just have to plug something into the USB port.

FAQ
-------

I tried it, and the images show up but they're flashing and moving around or
they don't show up at all. Why?

Right now, the exploit only works correctly when something is actually being
displayed to the screen. Otherwise, the monitor's firmware tries to use the OSD
(on screen display) hardware to display the "no input connected" message, which
makes strange things happen since we've already programmed the OSD ourselves.
Also, if the monitor goes into powersave mode (the power button goes yellow),
then the display is turned off and you won't see anything at all.
